class InfoExtractor(object):
    """Information Extractor class.

    Information extractors are the classes that, given a URL, extract
    information about the video (or videos) the URL refers to. This
    information includes the real video URL, the video title, author and
    others. The information is stored in a dictionary which is then
    passed to the YoutubeDL. The YoutubeDL processes this
    information possibly downloading the video to the file system, among
    other possible outcomes.

    The type field determines the type of the result.
    By far the most common value (and the default if _type is missing) is
    "video", which indicates a single video.

    For a video, the dictionaries must include the following fields:

    id:             Video identifier.
    title:          Video title, unescaped.

    Additionally, it must contain either a formats entry or a url one:

    formats:        A list of dictionaries for each format available, ordered
                    from worst to best quality.

                    Potential fields:

                                     - URL of the MPD manifest or base URL

                                       fragmented media)

                                 fragment_base_url must be present. Here is
                                 the list of all potential fields:

    _type "playlist" indicates multiple videos.
    There must be a key "entries", which is a list, an iterable, or a PagedList

    as videos (see above).

    It must have an entries key like a playlist and contain all the keys
    required for a video at the same time.


    _type "url" indicates that the video must be extracted from another
    location, possibly by a different extractor. Its only required key is:
    "url" - the next URL to extract.
    The key "ie_key" can be set to the class name (minus the trailing "IE",
    e.g. "Youtube") if the extractor class is known in advance.
    Additionally, the dictionary may have any properties of the resolved entity
    known in advance, for example "title" if the title of the referred video is
    known ahead of time.


    _type "url_transparent" entities have the same specification as "url", but
    indicate that the given additional information is more precise than the one
    associated with the resolved URL.
    This is useful when a site employs a video service that hosts the video and
    its technical metadata, but that video service does not embed a useful
    title, description etc.


    Subclasses of this one should re-define the _real_initialize() and
    _real_extract() methods and define a _VALID_URL regexp.
    Probably, they should also be added to the list of extractors.

    _GEO_BYPASS attribute may be set to False in order to disable
    geo restriction bypass mechanisms for a particular extractor.
    Though it won't disable explicit geo restriction bypass based on
    country code provided with geo_bypass_country.

    _GEO_COUNTRIES attribute may contain a list of presumably geo unrestricted
    countries for this extractor. One of these countries will be used by
    geo restriction bypass mechanism right away in order to bypass
    geo restriction, of course, if the mechanism is not disabled.

    _GEO_IP_BLOCKS attribute may contain a list of presumably geo unrestricted
    IP blocks in CIDR notation for this extractor. One of these IP blocks
    will be used by geo restriction bypass mechanism similarly
    to _GEO_COUNTRIES.

    Finally, the _WORKING attribute should be set to False for broken IEs
    in order to warn the users and skip the tests.
